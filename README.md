## **Project Overview**
This project enables **real-time product recognition** using **a smartphone camera and AI**.  
Users can scan **any random product (electronics, food, household items, etc.)**, and the system will identify it using **Google Gemini API**, providing details like **brand, release date, price, and specifications**.

---

## **Features**
- Scan any product using a smartphone camera
- AI-based product recognition using Google Gemini API
- Displays brand, release date, key specifications, and price (if available)
- Works on mobile devices without app installation
- HTTPS support via Ngrok for iOS compatibility
- Supports multiple product categories (smartphones, electronics, food, etc.)
- **QR Code Tracking**: Number of users scanning the QR code updates in real-time
- **Integration with 5Strack IoT Development Kit WM8978** for tracking and scanning
